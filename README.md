# Prep4Translit
## Description

The program imports a Microsoft word document (docx) and creates a new version which duplicates all Greek and Hebrew text in readiness for producing a transliteration using SIL's TECkit program

For example:    
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the common verb היי in the Qal binyan*       
would become    
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the common verb היי} היי} in the Qal binyan*
   
## Computer Requirements

This is a Windows (only) program which requires the .Net Framework version 4.5.2 or later, e.g. it will work with Windows 10

## Getting Started

As the program consistes of a single exe file an installer has not been provided</br>
Download a copy of the program and put it in a folder on your computer and run the program in the normal way (by clicking on the file name).

Hopefully the program will be intutitve / self explanatory. For more detail download the documentation file.
